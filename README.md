# Descriptive & Inferential Statistics

## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics are used to describe the characteristics or features of a dataset. The term ‘descriptive statistics’ can be used to describe both individual quantitative observations (also known as ‘summary statistics’) as well as the overall process of obtaining insights from these data. We can use descriptive statistics to describe both an entire population or an individual sample. Because they are merely explanatory, descriptive statistics are not heavily concerned with the differences between the two types of data.

### Common tools of descriptive statistics

Descriptive statistics frequently use the following statistical measures to describe groups:

Central tendency: Use the mean or the median to locate the center of the dataset. This measure tells you where most values fall.

Dispersion: How far out from the center do the data extend? You can use the range or standard deviation to measure the dispersion. A low dispersion indicates that the values cluster more tightly around the center. Higher dispersion signifies that data points fall further away from the center. We can also graph the frequency distribution.

Skewness: The measure tells you whether the distribution of values is symmetric or skewed. 

You can present this summary information using both numbers and graphs. These are the standard descriptive statistics, but there are other descriptive analyses you can perform, such as assessing the relationships of paired data using correlation and scatterplots.

## Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics takes data from a sample and makes inferences about the larger population from which the sample was drawn. Because the goal of inferential statistics is to draw conclusions from a sample and generalize them to a population, we need to have confidence that our sample accurately reflects the population. This requirement affects our process. At a broad level, we must do the following:

1.	Define the population we are studying.
2.	Draw a representative sample from that population.
3.	Use analyses that incorporate the sampling error.

We don’t get to pick a convenient group. Instead, random sampling allows us to have confidence that the sample represents the population. This process is a primary method for obtaining samples that mirrors the population on average. Random sampling produces statistics, such as the mean, that do not tend to be too high or too low. Using a random sample, we can generalize from the sample to the broader population. Unfortunately, gathering a truly random sample can be a complicated process. 

However, presuming we’ve obtained a random sample, there are many inferential techniques for analyzing and obtaining insights from those data. The list is long, but some techniques worthy of note include:

•	Hypothesis testing

•	Confidence intervals

•	Regression and correlation analysis
